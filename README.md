# Libft

you can expect some werid code in here because of optimization i intepreted from musl, glibc, FreeBSD, etc.
but it's quick for me but messy.

i tends to use 0x or 0b.

the key takeaway here is that
because the project is to recreate some of the c library
we can just look into the well known one like
musl - simple and short probably black magic
glibc - insane optimization but hard to intepret
FreeBSD - good optimization and mostly with primitive C

note: the code itself is pretty messy by my current standard but that is ok
