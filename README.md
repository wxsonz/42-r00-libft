# Libft
### This repo only contains original libft
i might make BeyondLibft later (BLFS naming yoink)\
you can expect some werid code in here\
because of optimization i intepreted from musl, glibc, FreeBSD, etc.\

### it's quick but messy.
\
for now you can probably read the comment in each file on what it does\
i will simplify the code later since it is hard to read\
\
the key takeaway here is that\
because the project is to recreate some of the c library\
we can just look into the well known one like\
musl - simple and short probably black magic\
glibc - insane optimization but hard to intepret\
FreeBSD - good optimization and mostly with primitive C\
\
note: the code itself is pretty messy by my current standard but that is ok

บอกเลย หิวข้าว
